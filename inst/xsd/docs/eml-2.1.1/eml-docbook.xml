<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
       The Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a metadata standard developed by
       the ecology discipline and for the ecology discipline. It is based on
       prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated
       efforts (Michener et al., 1997, Ecological Applications). EML is
       implemented as a series of XML document types that can by used in a
       modular and extensible manner to document ecological data. Each EML
       module is designed to describe one logical part of the total metadata
       that should be included with any ecological dataset.

<title>Purpose Statement</title>
<para>
        To provide the ecological community with an extensible, flexible,
        metadata standard for use in data analysis and archiving that will
        allow automated machine processing, searching and retrieval.

<title>Features</title>
<para>
        The architecture of EML was designed to serve the needs of the
        ecological community, and has benefitted from previous work in other
        related metadata languages. EML has adopted the strengths of many of
        these languages, but also addresses a number of short-comings that
        have proved to inhibit the automated processing and integration of
        dataset resources via their metadata.
      </para>
<para>
        The following list represents some of the features of EML:
      </para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
        Modularity: EML was designed as a collection of modules rather than
        one large standard to facilitate future growth of the language in both
        breadth and depth.  By implementing EML with an extensible
        architecture, groups may choose which of the core modules are
        pertinent to describing their data, literature, and software
        resources.  Also, if EML falls short in a particular area, it may be
        extended by creating a new module that describes the resource (e.g. a
        detailed soils metadata profile that extends eml-dataset).  The intent
        is to provide a common set of core modules for information exchange,
        but to allow for future customizations of the language without the
        need of going through a lengthy 'approval' process.
        </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
        Detailed Structure: EML strives to balance the tradeoff of too much
        detail with enough detail to enable advanced services in terms of
        processing data through the parsing of accompanied metadata.
        Therefore, a driving question throughout the design was: 'Will this
        particular piece of information be machine-processed, just human
        readable, or both?'  Information was then broken down into more highly
        structured elements when the answer involved machine processing.
        </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
        Compatibility: EML adopts much of it's syntax from the other metadata
        standards that have evolved from the expertise of groups in other
        disciplines.  Whenever possible, EML adopted entire trees of
        information in order to facilitate conversion of EML documents into
        other metadata languages.  EML was designed with the following
        standards in mind: Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, the Content
        Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM from the US geological
        Survey's Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC)), the Biological
        Profile of the CSDGM (from the National Biological Information
        Infrastructure), the International Standards Organization's Geographic
        Information Standard (ISO 19115), the ISO 8601 Date and Time Standard,
        the OpenGIS Consortiums's Geography Markup Language (GML), the
        Scientific, Technical, and Medical Markup Language (STMML), and the
        Extensible Scientific Interchange Language (XSIL).
        </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
        Strong Typing: EML is implemented in an Extensible Markup Language
        (XML) known as <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema">XML
        Schema</ulink>, which is a language that defines the rules
        that govern the EML syntax.  XML Schema is an internet recommendation
        from the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</ulink>,
        and so a
        metadata document that is said to comply with the syntax of EML will
        structurally meet the criteria defined in the XML Schema documents for
        EML.  Over and above the structure (what elements can be nested within
        others, cardinality, etc.), XML Schema provides the ability to use
        strong
        data typing within elements.  This allows for finer validation of the
        contents of the element, not just it's structure.  For instance, an
        element may be of type 'date', and so the value that is inserted in
        the field will be checked against XML Schema's definition of a date.
        Traditionally, XML documents (including previous versions of EML)
        have been validated against Document Type
        Definitions (DTDs), which do not provide a means to employ strong
        validation on field values through typing.
        </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>
        There is a distinction between the content model (i.e. the concepts
        behind the structure of a document - which fields go where, cardinality,
        etc.) and the syntactic implementation of that model (the technology
        used to express the concepts defined in the content model).
        The normative sections below define the content model and the
        XML Schema documents distributed with EML define the syntactic
        implementation. For the foreseeable future, XML Schema will be the
        syntactic specification, although it may change later.

<title>Module Overview Foreword</title>
<para>
        The following section briefly describes each EML module and how they
        are logically designed in order to document ecological resources.
        Some of the modules are dependent on others, while others may be used
        as stand-alone descriptions.  This section describes the modules using
        a "top down" approach, starting from the top-level eml wrapper
        module, followed by modules of increasing detail.  However, there are
        modules that may be used at many levels, such as eml-access.
        These modules are described when it is appropriate.

            <title> The eml module - A metadata container </title>
            <para> The eml module is a wrapper container that allows the inclusion of any metadata
              content in a single EML document. The eml module is used as a container to hold
              structured descriptions of ecological resources. In EML, the definition of a resource
              comes from the <ulink url="http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/">
                <citetitle> The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative </citetitle>
              </ulink>, which describes a general element set used to describe "networked digital
              resources". The top-level structure of EML has been designed to be compatible with the
              Dublin Core syntax. In general, dataset resources, literature resources, software
              resources, and protocol resources comprise the list of information that may be
              described in EML. EML is largely designed to describe digital resources, however, it
              may also be used to describe non-digital resources such as paper maps and other
              non-digital media. <emphasis> In EML, the definition of a "Data Package" is the
                combination of both the data and metadata for a resource. </emphasis> So, data
              packages are built by using the &lt;eml&gt; wrapper, which will include all of
              the metadata, and optionally the data (or references to them). All EML packages must
              begin with the &lt;eml&gt; tag and end with the &lt;/eml&gt; tag. </para>
            <para> The eml module may be extended to describe other resources by means of its
              optional sub-field, &lt;additionalMetadata&gt;. This field is largely reserved
              for the inclusion of metadata that may be highly discipline specific and not covered
              in this version of EML, or it may be used to internally extend fields within the EML
              standard. </para>

              The eml-resource module - Base information for
              all resources
            </title>
            <para>
              The eml-resource module contains general information that
              describes dataset resources, literature resources, protocol
              resources, and software resources. Each of the above four types of
              resources share a common set of information, but also have
              information that is unique to that particular resource type.  Each
              resource type uses the eml-resource module to document the
              information common to all resources, but then extend
              eml-resource with modules that are specific to that particular
              resource type.  For instance, all resources have creators,
              titles, and perhaps keywords, but only the dataset resource would
              have a "data table" within it.  Likewise, a literature
              resource may have an "ISBN" number associated with it,
              whereas the other resource types would not.
            </para>
            <para>
              The eml-resource module is exclusively used by other modules, and is
              therefore not a stand-alone module.

          Top-level resources

<para>
        The following four modules are used to describe separate resources:
        datasets, literature, software, and protocols.  However, note that
        the dataset module makes use of the other top-level modules by
        importing them at different levels.  For instance, a dataset may
        have been produced using a particular protocol, and that protocol
        may come from a protocol document in a library of protocols.
        Likewise, citations are used throughout the top-level resource
        modules by importing the literature module.

            <para>
              The eml-dataset module contains general information that describes
              dataset resources. It is intended to provide overview information
              about the dataset: broad information such as the title, abstract,
              keywords, contacts, maintenance history, purpose, and distribution
              of the data themselves. The eml-dataset module also imports many
              other modules that are used to describe the dataset in fine
              detail.  Specifically, it uses the eml-methods module to
              describe methodology used in collecting or processing the
              dataset, the eml-project module to describe the overarching
              research context and experimental design, the eml-access module
              to define access control rules for the data and metadata, and
              the eml-entity module to provide detailed information about the
              logical structure of the dataset. A dataset can be (and often is)
              composed of a series of data entities (tables) that are linked
              together by particular integrity constraints.

              The eml-literature module contains information that describes
              literature resources. It is intended to provide overview
              information about the literature citation, including title,
              abstract, keywords, and contacts. Citation types follow the
              conventions laid out by

              and there is an attempt to
              represent a compatible subset of the EndNote citation types.
              These citation types include: article, book, chapter, edited
              book, manuscript, report, thesis, conference proceedings,
              personal communication, map, generic, audio visual, and
              presentation.  The "generic" citation type would be

          Supporting Modules - Adding detail to top-level resources
        </title>
<para>
            The following six modules are used to qualify the resources being
            described in more detail.  They are used to describe access control
            rules, distribution of the metadata and data themselves, parties
            associated with the resource, the geographic, temporal, and
            taxonomic extents of the resource, the overall research context of
            the resource, and detailed methodology used for creating the
            resource.  Some of these modules are imported directly into the
            top-level resource modules, often in many locations in order to
            limit the scope of the description.  For instance, the eml-coverage
            module may be used for a particular column of a dataset, rather
            than the entire dataset as a whole.

              The eml-access module - Access control rules for resources
            </title>
            <para>
              The eml-access module describes the level of access that is
              to be allowed or denied to a resource for a particular user or 
              group of users, and can be described independently for metadata 
              and data.  The eml-access
              module uses a reference to a particular authentication system
              to determine the set of principals (users or groups) that can be
              specified in the access rules.
              The special principal 'public' can be used to indicate that any
              user or group has access permission, thereby making
              it easier to specify that anonymous access is allowed. 
             </para>
            <para>        
              There are two mechanisms for including access control 
              via the eml-access module: 
              <orderedlist inheritnum="ignore" continuation="restarts">
                <listitem>
                  <para>
                    The top-level "eml" element may have an optional 
                    &lt;access&gt; element that is used to establish the 
                    default access control for the entire EML package. If 
                    this access element is omitted from the document, then 
                    the package submitter should be given full access to the 
                    package but all other users should be denied all access. 
                    To allow the package to be publicly viewable, the EML 
                    author must explicitly include a rule stating so.  Barring 
                    the existence of a distribution-level &lt;access&gt; element 
                    (see below), access to data entities will be controlled by 
                    the package-level &lt;access&gt; element in the 
                    &lt;eml&gt; element.

                <listitem>
                  <para>
                    Exceptions for particular entity-level components of the 
                    package can be controlled at a finer grain by using an 
                    access description in that entity's physical/distribution 
                    tree. When access control rules are specified at this 
                    level, they apply only to the data in the parent 
                    distribution element, and not to the metadata. Thus, it 
                    will control access to the content of the &lt;inline&gt; 
                    element, as well as resources that are referenced by the 
                    &lt;online/url&gt; and &lt;online/connection&gt; paths. 
                    These exceptions to access for particular data resources 
                    are applied after the default access rules at the 
                    package-level have been applied, so they effectively 
                    override the default rules when they overlap.

            </para>
            <para>
              In previous versions of EML access rules for entity-level 
              distribution were contained in &lt;additionalMetadata&gt; 
              sections and referenced via the &lt;describes&gt; tag. 
              Although in theory these could have referenced any node, in 
              application such node-level access control is problematic. 
              Since the most common uses of access control rules were to 
              limit access to specific data entities, the access tree has 
              been placed there explicitly in EML 2.1.0.
            </para>          
            <para>
              Access is specified with a choice of child elements, either 
              &lt;allow&gt; or &lt;deny&gt;. Within these rules, values can 
              be assigned for each &lt;principal&gt; using the 
              &lt;permission&gt; element. Users given "read" permission can 
              view the resource; "write" allows changes to the resource 
              excluding changes to the access rules; "changePermission" 
              includes "write" plus the changing of access rules. Users 
              allowed "all" permissions; may do all of the above.  Access to 
              data and metadata is affected by the order attribute of the 
              &lt;access&gt; element. It is possible for a deny rule to 
              override an allow rule, and vice versa.  In the case where the 
              order attribute is set to "allowFirst", and there are rules 
              similar to the following (with non-critical sections deleted):
<literalLayout>
  &lt;deny&gt;
    &lt;principal&gt;public&lt;/principal&gt;
    &lt;permission&gt;read&lt;/permission&gt;
  &lt;/deny&gt;

    &lt;permission&gt;read&lt;/permission&gt;
  &lt;/allow&gt;
</literalLayout>
              the principal "uid=alice ..." will be denied access, 
              because it is a member of the special "public" 
              principal, and the deny rule is processed second. For this 
              allow rule to truly allow access to that principal, the order 
              attribute should be set to "denyFirst", and the 
              allow rule will override the deny rule when it is processed 
              second.              
            </para>
            <para>
              An example is given below, with non-critical sections deleted:

        &lt;allow&gt;
      &lt;/access&gt;
      &lt;dataset&gt;

            authSystem="ldap://ldap.ecoinformatics.org:389/dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org" 
            order="allowFirst"&gt;
              &lt;deny&gt;
                &lt;principal&gt;uid=alice,o=NASA,dc=ecoinformatics,dc=org&lt;/principal&gt;
                &lt;permission&gt;write&lt;/permission&gt;
            &lt;/deny&gt;
          &lt;/access&gt;
         &lt;/distribution&gt;
       &lt;/physical&gt;
      &lt;/dataTable&gt;
      &lt;dataTable id="entity234"&gt;
        ...
        &lt;physical&gt;
        ...
          &lt;distribution&gt;
            ...
            &lt;access&gt;
              &lt;references&gt;access123&lt;/references&gt;
            &lt;/access&gt;
          &lt;/distribution&gt;
        &lt;/physical&gt;
      &lt;/dataTable&gt;
      ...    
    &lt;/dataset&gt;
  &lt;eml&gt;
</literalLayout>
              In this example, the overall default access is to allow the 
              user=alice (but no one else) to read and write all metadata 
              and data. However, under "entity123" and 
              "entity234", there is an additional rule saying 
              that user=alice does not have write permission. The net 
              effect is that Alice can read and make changes to the 
              metadata, but cannot make changes to the two data entities. 
              In addition, Alice cannot change these access rules; although 
              the submitter can.
            </para>
            <para>
              This example also shows how the eml-access module, like other modules,
              may be "referenced" via the &lt;references&gt; tag.  This
              allows an access control document to be described once, and then
              used as a reference in other locations within the EML document
              via its ID.
            </para>
            <para>
            In summary, access rules can be applied in two places in an
            eml document. Default access rules are established
            in the top &lt;access&gt; element for the main eml document (e.g.,
            "/eml/access").  These default rules can be overridden
            for particular data entities by adding additional &lt;access&gt;
            elements in the physical/distribution trees of those entities.

            The eml-coverage module - Geographic, temporal, and taxonomic extents
            of resources
          </title>
            <para>
            The eml-coverage module contains fields for describing the coverage
            of a resource in terms of time, space, and taxonomy. These
            coverages (temporal, spatial, and taxonomic) represent the extent
            of applicability of the resource in those domains.
            The Geographic coverage section allows for 2 means of expressing
            coverage
            on the surface of the earth: 1) via a set of bounding coordinates
            that define the North, South, East and West points in a rectangular
            area, optionally including a bounding altitude,
            and 2) using a G-Ring polygon definition, where an irregularly
            shaped area may be defined using a ordered list of
            latitude/longitude coordinates.  A G-Ring may also include an
            "inner G-Ring" that defines one or more
            "cut-outs" in the area, i.e. the donut hole concept.
          </para>
            <para>
            The temporal coverage section allows for the definition of either a
            single date or time, or a range of dates or times. These may be
            expressed as a calendar date according to the ISO 8601 Date and Time
            Specification, or by using an alternate time scale, such as the
            geologic time scale. Currently, EML does not have specific fields to indicate
            that a data resource may be "ongoing." Two examples are data tables 
			that are planned to be appended in the future, or resources 
            with complex connection definitions (such as to a database) which may return 
			data in real time. It is important that EML be 
            able to  handle data from both the "producer" and "consumer" points of view,
            although currently the temporal coverage modules are designed for the latter.
            There is no universally acceptable recommendation for describing "ongoing" data
            within EML. Some groups have chosen to use the &lt;alternateTimeScale&gt; 
            node for the end date, with a value of "ongoing," although this practice
            is not endorsed by the EML authors. A better solution could be to use very
			general content for the endDate (such as only the current year) so that the 
			data are accurately described, and searches return datasets as expected.
			A future version of EML will 
            accommodate such data types with coverage elements specific to their needs.
          </para>
            <para>
            The taxonomic coverage section allows for detailed description of
            the taxonomic extent of the dataset or resource.  The taxonomic
            classification consists of a recursive set of taxon rank names,
            their values, and their common names.  This construct allows for a
            taxonomic hierarchy to be built to show the level of identification
            (e.g. Rank Name = Kingdom, Rank Value = Animalia, Common Name =
            Animals, and so on down the hierarchy.) The taxonomic coverage
            module also allows for the definition of the classification system
            in cases where alternative systems are used.

            processes that have been used to define / improve the quality of a
            data file, or to identify potential problems with the data file.
            Note that the eml-protocol module is intended to be used to document

            and the term "method" is used in the
            "descriptive" sense.  This distinction allows managers to
            build a protocol library of well-known, established protocols
            (procedures), but also document what procedure was truly performed
            in relation to the established protocol.  The method may have
            diverged from the protocol purposefully, or perhaps incidentally,
            but the procedural lineage is still preserved and understandable.

          Data organization - Modules describing dataset structures
        </title>
<para>
            The following three modules are used to document the logical layout
            of a dataset.  Many datasets are comprised of multiple entities
            (e.g. a series of tabular data files, or a set of GIS features, or a
            number of tables in a relational database).  Each entity within a
            dataset may contain one or more attributes (e.g. multiple columns in
            a data file, multiple attributes of a GIS feature, or multiple
            columns of a database table).  Lastly, there may be both simple or
            complex  relationships among the entities within a dataset.  The
            relationships, or the constraints that are to be enforced in the
            dataset, are described using the eml-constraint module.  All
            entities share a common set of information (described using
            eml-entity), but some discipline specific entities have
            characteristics that are unique to that entity type.  Therefore, the
            eml-entity module is extended for each of these types (dataTable,
            spatialRaster, spatialVector, etc...) which are described
            in the next section.

            <para>
              The eml-entity module defines the logical characteristics of
              each entity in the dataset. Entities are usually tables of
              data (eml-dataTable). Data tables may be ascii text files,
              relational database tables, spreadsheets or other type of
              tabular data with a fixed logical structure. Related to data
              tables are views (eml-view) and stored
              procedures (eml-storedProcedure). Views and stored procedures
              are produced by an RDBMS or related system. Other types of data
              such as: raster (eml-spatialRaster), vector (eml-spatialVector) or
              spatialReference image data are also data entities. An
              otherEntity element would be used to describe types of entities
              that are not described by any other entity type.

            in this module: 1.  attribute is used to define a single attribute;
            2. attributeList is used to define a list of attributes that go
            together in some logical way.

            The eml-attribute module, like other modules, may be
            "referenced" via the &lt;references&gt; tag.  This
            allows an attribute document to be described once, and then
            used as a reference in other locations within the EML document
            via its ID.

              <title>Philosophy of Attribute Units</title>
              <para>The concept of "unit" represents one of the most fundamental
            categories of metadata. The classic example of data entropy is the
            case in which a reported numeric value loses meaning due to lack of
            associated units. Much of Ecology is driven by measurement, and
            most measurements are inherently comparative. Good data description
            requires a representation of the basis for comparison, i.e., the
            unit. In modeling the attribute element, the authors of EML drew
            inspiration from the
            <ulink url="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/introduction.html">
            NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty</ulink>.
            This document defines a unit as "a particular physical quantity,
            defined and adopted by convention, with which other particular
            quantities of the same kind are compared to express their value."
            The authors of the EML 2.0 specification (hereafter "the authors")
            decided to make the unit element required, wherever
            possible.</para>
              <para>Units may also be one of the most problematic categories of
            metadata. For instance, there are many candidate attributes that
            clearly have no units, such as named places and letter grades.
            There are other candidate attributes for which units are difficult
            to identify, despite some suspicion that they should exist (e.g.
            pH, dates, times). In still other cases, units may be meaningful,
            but apparently absent due to dimensional analysis (e.g. grams of
            carbon per gram of soil). The relationship between units and
            dimensions likewise is not completely clear.</para>
              <para>The authors decided to sharpen the model of attribute by
            nesting unit under measurementScale. Measurement Scale is a data
            typology, borrowed from Statistics, that was introduced in the
            1940's. Under the adopted model, attributes are classified as
            nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Though widely criticized,
            this classification is well-known and provides at least first-order
            utility in EML. For example, nesting unit under measurementScale
            allows EML to prevent its meaningless inclusion for categorical
            data -- an approach judged superior to making unit universally
            required or universally optional.</para>
              <para>The sharpening of the attribute model allowed the elimination
            of the unit type "undefined" from the standard unit dictionary (see
            eml-unitDictionary.xml). It seemed self-defeating to require the
            unit element exactly where appropriate, yet still allow its content
            to be undefined. An attribute that requires a unit definition is
            malformed until one is provided. The unit type "dimensionless" is
            preserved, however. In EML 2.0, it is synonymous with "unitless"
            and represents the case in which units cannot be associated with an
            attribute for some reason, despite the proper classification of
            that attribute as interval or ratio. Dimensionless may itself be an
            anomaly arising from the limitations of the adopted measurement
            scale typology.</para>
              <para>Closely related to the concept of unit is the concept of
            attribute domain. The authors decided that a well-formed
            description of an attribute must include some indication of the set
            of possible values for that attribute. The set of possible values
            is useful, perhaps necessary, for interpreting any particular
            observed value. While universally required, attribute domain has
            different forms, depending on the associated measurement
            scale.</para>
              <para>The element storageType has an obvious relationship to
            domain. It gives some indication of the range of possible values of
            an attribute, and also gives some (potentially critical)
            operability information about the way the attribute is represented
            or construed in the local storage system. The storageType element
            seems to fall in a gray area between the logical and physical
            aspects of stored data. Neither comfortable with eliminating it nor
            with making it required, the authors left it available but optional
            under attribute. In addition, it is repeatable so that different 
            storage types can be provided for various systems (e.g., different
            databases might use different types for columns, even though the
            domain of the attribute is the same regardless of which database
            is used).</para>
              <para>Attributes representing dates, times, or combinations thereof
            (hereafter "dateTime") were the most difficult to model in EML. Is
            dateTime of type interval or ordinal? Does it have units or not?
            Strong cases can be made on each side of the issue. The confusion
            may reflect the limitations of the measurement scale typology. The
            final resolution of the dateTime model is probably somewhat
            arbitrary. There was clearly a need, however, to allow for the
            interoperability of dateTime formats. EML 2.0 tries to provide an
            unambiguous mechanism for describing the format of dateTime
            values by providing a separate category for date and  time values. This
            "dateTime" measurement scale allows users to explicitly label 
            attributes that contain Gregorian date and time values, and allows
            them to provide the information needed to parse these values into
            their appropriate components (e.g., days, months, years)./</para>

          Entity types - Detailed information for discipline specific entities

<para>
             The following six modules are used to describe a number of common
             types of entities found in datasets.  Each entity type uses the
             eml-entity module elements as it's base set of elements, but then
             extends the base with entity-specific elements.  Note that the
             eml-spatialReference module is not an entity type, but is rather a
             common set of elements used to describe spatial reference systems
             in both eml-spatialRaster and eml-spatialVector.  It is described
             here in relation to those two modules.

          <para>
            The eml-dataTable module is used to describe the logical
            characteristics of each tabular set of information in a dataset. A
            series of comma-separated text files may be considered a dataset,
            and each file would subsequently be considered a dataTable entity
            within the dataset.  Since the eml-dataTable module extends the
            eml-entity module, it uses all of the common entity elements to
            describe the table, along with a few elements specific to just data
            table entities.  The eml-dataTable module allows for the
            description of each attribute (column/field/variable) within the
            data table through the use of the eml-attribute module.  Likewise,
            there are fields used to describe the physical distribution of the
            data table, its overall coverage, the methodology used in creating
            the data, and other logical structure information such as its
            orientation, case sensitivity, etc.

<title>Module Structure</title>
<para>
        Each EML module, with the exception of "eml" itself, has a top level
        choice between the structured content of that modules or a
        "references" field.  This enables the reuse of content
        previously defined elsewhere in the document.  Methods for defining
        and referencing content are described in the

<title>Reusable Content</title>
<para>
        EML allows the reuse of previously defined structured content (DOM
        sub-trees) through the use of key/keyRef type references.  In order
        for an EML package to remain cohesive and to allow for the cross
        platform compatibility of packages, the following rules with respect
        to packaging must be followed.

<title>EML Parser</title>
<para>
        Because some of these rules cannot be enforced in XML-Schema, we have
        written a parser which checks the validity of the references and IDs
        used in your document.  This parser is included with the 2.1.0 release
        of EML.  To run the parser, you must have Java 1.3.1 or higher.  To
        execute it change into the lib directory of the release and run
        the 'runEMLParser' script passing your EML instance file as a
        parameter.  There is also an <ulink url="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/emlparser">online
        version</ulink> of this parser which is publicly accessible.  The online
        parser will both validate your XML document against the schema as
        well as check the integrity of your references.
