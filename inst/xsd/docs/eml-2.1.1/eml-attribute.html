            The eml-attribute module - Attribute level information within
            dataset entities
          </div>
            
<p>
            The eml-attribute module describes all attributes (variables)
            in a data entity: dataTable, spatialRaster, spatialVector,
            storedProcedure, view or otherEntity. The description includes the
            name and definition of each attribute, its domain, definitions of
            coded values, and other pertinent information. Two structures exist
            in this module: 1.  attribute is used to define a single attribute;
            2. attributeList is used to define a list of attributes that go
            together in some logical way.
          </p>
            
<p>
            The eml-attribute module, like other modules, may be
            "referenced" via the &lt;references&gt; tag.  This
            allows an attribute document to be described once, and then
            used as a reference in other locations within the EML document
            via its ID.
            </p>
            
              
<div class="sectiontitle">Philosophy of Attribute Units</div>
              
<p>The concept of "unit" represents one of the most fundamental
            categories of metadata. The classic example of data entropy is the
            case in which a reported numeric value loses meaning due to lack of
            associated units. Much of Ecology is driven by measurement, and
            most measurements are inherently comparative. Good data description
            requires a representation of the basis for comparison, i.e., the
            unit. In modeling the attribute element, the authors of EML drew
            inspiration from the
            <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/introduction.html">
            NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty</a>.
            This document defines a unit as "a particular physical quantity,
            defined and adopted by convention, with which other particular
            quantities of the same kind are compared to express their value."
            The authors of the EML 2.0 specification (hereafter "the authors")
            decided to make the unit element required, wherever
            possible.</p>
              
<p>Units may also be one of the most problematic categories of
            metadata. For instance, there are many candidate attributes that
            clearly have no units, such as named places and letter grades.
            There are other candidate attributes for which units are difficult
            to identify, despite some suspicion that they should exist (e.g.
            pH, dates, times). In still other cases, units may be meaningful,
            but apparently absent due to dimensional analysis (e.g. grams of
            carbon per gram of soil). The relationship between units and
            dimensions likewise is not completely clear.</p>
              
<p>The authors decided to sharpen the model of attribute by
            nesting unit under measurementScale. Measurement Scale is a data
            typology, borrowed from Statistics, that was introduced in the
            1940's. Under the adopted model, attributes are classified as
            nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. Though widely criticized,
            this classification is well-known and provides at least first-order
            utility in EML. For example, nesting unit under measurementScale
            allows EML to prevent its meaningless inclusion for categorical
            data -- an approach judged superior to making unit universally
            required or universally optional.</p>
              
<p>The sharpening of the attribute model allowed the elimination
            of the unit type "undefined" from the standard unit dictionary (see
            eml-unitDictionary.xml). It seemed self-defeating to require the
            unit element exactly where appropriate, yet still allow its content
            to be undefined. An attribute that requires a unit definition is
            malformed until one is provided. The unit type "dimensionless" is
            preserved, however. In EML 2.0, it is synonymous with "unitless"
            and represents the case in which units cannot be associated with an
            attribute for some reason, despite the proper classification of
            that attribute as interval or ratio. Dimensionless may itself be an
            anomaly arising from the limitations of the adopted measurement
            scale typology.</p>
              
<p>Closely related to the concept of unit is the concept of
            attribute domain. The authors decided that a well-formed
            description of an attribute must include some indication of the set
            of possible values for that attribute. The set of possible values
            is useful, perhaps necessary, for interpreting any particular
            observed value. While universally required, attribute domain has
            different forms, depending on the associated measurement
            scale.</p>
              
<p>The element storageType has an obvious relationship to
            domain. It gives some indication of the range of possible values of
            an attribute, and also gives some (potentially critical)
            operability information about the way the attribute is represented
            or construed in the local storage system. The storageType element
            seems to fall in a gray area between the logical and physical
            aspects of stored data. Neither comfortable with eliminating it nor
            with making it required, the authors left it available but optional
            under attribute. In addition, it is repeatable so that different 
            storage types can be provided for various systems (e.g., different
            databases might use different types for columns, even though the
            domain of the attribute is the same regardless of which database
            is used).</p>
              
<p>Attributes representing dates, times, or combinations thereof
            (hereafter "dateTime") were the most difficult to model in EML. Is
            dateTime of type interval or ordinal? Does it have units or not?
            Strong cases can be made on each side of the issue. The confusion
            may reflect the limitations of the measurement scale typology. The
            final resolution of the dateTime model is probably somewhat
            arbitrary. There was clearly a need, however, to allow for the
            interoperability of dateTime formats. EML 2.0 tries to provide an
            unambiguous mechanism for describing the format of dateTime
            values by providing a separate category for date and  time values. This
            "dateTime" measurement scale allows users to explicitly label 
            attributes that contain Gregorian date and time values, and allows
            them to provide the information needed to parse these values into
            their appropriate components (e.g., days, months, years)./</p>

<blockquote>The content model for attribute is a CHOICE between
        "references" and all of the elements that let you describe the
        attribute (e.g., attributeName, attributeDefinition, precision). The
        attribute element allows a user to document the characteristics that
        describe a 'field' or 'variable' in a data entity (e.g. dataTable).
        Complete attribute descriptions are perhaps the most important aspect
        to making data understandable to others. An attribute element describes
        a single attribute or an attribute element can contain a reference
        to an attribute defined elsewhere. Using a reference means that the
        referenced attribute is (semantically) identical, not just in name
        but identical in its complete description. For example, if attribute
        "measurement1" in dataTable "survey1" has a precision of 0.1 and
        you are documenting dataTable survey2 which has an attribute called
        "measurement1" but the survey2's measurement1 has a precision of
        0.001 then these are different attributes and must be described
        separately.</blockquote>

<p>The dateTime field is used for defining the
                    characteristics of the attribute if it contains
                    date and time values. DateTime is used when the values
                    fall on the Gregorian calendar system.  DateTime values
                    are special because the have properties of interval
                    values (most of the time it is legitimate to treat them
                    as interval values by converting them to a duration from
                    a fixed point) but they sometimes only behave as ordinals
                    (because the calendar is not predetermined, for some
                    dateTime values one can only find out the order of
                    the points and not the magnitude of the duration 
                    between those points).  Thus, the dateTime scale provides
                    the information necessary to properly understand and
                    parse date and time values without improperly 
                    labeling them under one of the more traditional scales.</p>
                      
<p>Date and time values are unlike any other measured values.  
                      Note that the dateTime field would not be used if
              one is recording time durations.  In that case, one should use a
              standard unit such as seconds, nominalMinute or nominalDay, or a
              customUnit that defines the unit in terms of its relationship to
              SI second.</p>

<p>
              Some notes about these examples.  First, the ISO 8601 standard is
              strict about the order of date components and the separators that
              are legal.  Best practice is to follow the ISO 8601 format
              precisely.  However, we recognize that existing data contain
              non-standard dates, and existing equipment (e.g., sensors) may
              still be producing non-standard dates.  Consequently, we have
              provided the formatting string with additional characters to
              describe the date formats. In particular note that the use of a
              slash (/) to separate date components, a space to separate date
              and time components, using a twelve-hour time with am/pm
              designator, and placing any of the components out of
              descending order is non-standard according to ISO.  Nevertheless,
              these formats can be described using the format string to
              accommodate existing data.
              </p>
                            
<p>
              Decimal dateTime values can be extended by indicating in
              the format that additional decimals can be used.  Only the final
              unit (e.g., seconds in a time value) can use the extended digits
              according to the ISO 8601 standard.  For example, to show
              indicate that seconds are represented to the nearest 1/1000
              of a second, the format string would be "hh:mm:ss.sss".
              Note that this only indicates the number of decimals used to
              record the value, and not the precision of the measurement
              (see dateTimePrecision for that).
              </p>
                            
<p>
              Date and time values are from an interval scale, but it is extremely
              complex because of the vagaries of the calendar (e.g., leap
              years, and leap seconds).  The duration between date and time values
              in the future is not even deterministic because leap seconds are
              based on current measurements of the earth's orbit. Consequently,
              date and time values are unlike any other measured values.  The format
              string for dateTime values allows one to accurately calculate the
              duration in SI second units between two measured dateTime values,
              assuming that the conversion software has a detailed knowledge of
              the Gregorian calendar.

                          The precision should be interpreted in the
                          smallest units represented by the dateTime format.
                          For example, if a dateTime value has a format of

        repeatable measurements are.  A precise measuring instrument will give 
        very nearly the same result each time it is used. This means that 
        someone interpreting the data should expect that if a measurement were 
        repeated, most measured values would fall within the interval specified 
        by the precision. The value of precision should be expressed in the
        same unit as the measurement. For example, for an attribute with unit 
        "meter", a precision of "0.1" would be interpreted to mean that most 
        repeat measurements would fall within an interval of 1/10th of a meter.

<blockquote>The non-numeric domain field describes the domain
        of the attribute being documented.  It can describe two
        different types of domains: enumerated and text.  Enumerated
        domains are lists of values that are explicitly provided as
        legitimate values.  Only values from that list should occur
        in the attribute.  They are often used for response codes
        such as "HIGH" and "LOW".  Text domains are used for attributes
        that allow more free-form text fields, but still permit some
        specification of the value-space through pattern matching.  A
        text domain is usually used for comment and notes attributes,
        and other character attributes that don't have a precise set of
        constrained values. This is an important field for post processing
        and error checking of the dataset. It represents a formal 
        specification of the value space for the attribute, and so there 
        should never be a value for the attribute that falls outside of 
        the set of values prescribed by the domain.</blockquote>
