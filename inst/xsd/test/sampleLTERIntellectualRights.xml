				<title>Conditions of Use</title>
				<para>The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration
and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged.
Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following
terms:</para>
				<para>
					<orderedlist>
						<listitem>
							<para> <emphasis>Acceptable use</emphasis>. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational,
government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is
permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are
released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Data Set. Any other
uses for the Data Set or its derived products will require explicit permission from the

The Data User will not redistribute the original Data Set beyond this collaboration sphere.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para>Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other
scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Data Set in any publications or in the
metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Data Set. Citation
should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of
Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. For example:

publications where the Data Set contributed significantly to its content.
Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the
support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. For example:</para>
							<para>
Data sets were provided by the Forest Science Data Bank, a partnership between the
Department of Forest Science, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Forest Service Pacific
Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon. Significant funding for collection of these
data was provided by the National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research
program (NSF Grant numbers BSR-90-11663 and DEB-96-32921).
</para>

Notification will include an explanation of how the Data Set was used to produce the
derived work.
</para>
						</listitem>
						<listitem>
							<para><emphasis>Collaboration</emphasis>. The Data Set has been released in the spirit of open scientific
collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation,
collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Data Set Creator.</para>
