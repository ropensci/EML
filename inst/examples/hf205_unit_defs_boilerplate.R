###### Write metadata ####


col.defs <- c("run.num" = "which run number (=block). Range: 1 - 6. (integer)",
              "year" = "year, 2012",
              "day" = "Julian day. Range: 170 - 209.",
              "hour.min" = "hour and minute of observation. Range 1 - 2400 (integer)",
              "i.flag" =  "is variable Real, Interpolated or Bad (character/factor)",
              "variable" = "what variable being measured in what treatment (character/factor).",
              "value.i" = "value of measured variable for run.num on year/day/hour.min.")

# the following commented section is from the original example
# I found this process to actually work better in the Morpho software
# which is a GUI to document data in the EML standard.
# however getting the rest of the metadata for the unit definitions generated in R EML package
# (even just as a skeleton, to be expanded on in Morpho) has provided a lot of benefits in terms of
# A) time. The Morpho GUI steps through one column at a time and it
# slows down each time it moves to next col... crashing after about a
# hundred cols
# B) ensuring the metadata closely aligns to the data (character
# cannot be mis-labelled as number for example when documenting a
# factor variable with "nominal" numbers)

# so this is the old example
## unit.defs = list("which run number",

##                    high = "1.0 mg prey added ml-1 d-1",
##                    air.temp = "air temperature measured just above all plants (1 thermocouple)",

## We might define smaller blocks of text in the script itself.
abstract <- "The primary goal of this project is to determine
  experimentally the amount of lead time required to prevent a state
  change. To achieve this goal, we will (1) experimentally induce state
  changes in a natural aquatic ecosystem - the Sarracenia microecosystem;
  (2) use proteomic analysis to identify potential indicators of states
  and state changes; and (3) test whether we can forestall state changes
  by experimentally intervening in the system. This work uses state-of-the
  art molecular tools to identify early warning indicators in the field
  of aerobic to anaerobic state changes driven by nutrient enrichment
  in an aquatic ecosystem. The study tests two general hypotheses: (1)
  proteomic biomarkers can function as reliable indicators of impending
  state changes and may give early warning before increasing variances
  and statistical flickering of monitored variables; and (2) well-timed
  intervention based on proteomic biomarkers can avert future state changes
  in ecological systems."
