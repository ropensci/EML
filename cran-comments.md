This release fixes an issue created by the upcoming 0.5.0 release of `emld`.  Checks
will pass once that version (emld 0.5.0) is accepted to CRAN (currently in pending
with no errors, notes, or warnings, but does trigger the revdep check for this package
to fail).  Thanks.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes
