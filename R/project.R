#' The project module
#'
#' The eml-project module describes the research context in which the dataset
#' was created, including descriptions of over-all motivations and goals,
#' funding, personnel, description of the study area etc. This is also the
#' module to describe the design of the project: the scientific questions being
#' asked, the architecture of the design, etc. This module is used to place the
#' dataset that is being documented into its larger research context. (cite eml
#' documentation).

#' The module includes
#'       eml-documentation, 
#'       eml-resource, 
#'       eml-party, 
#'       eml-coverage, 
#'       eml-literature, 
#'       eml-text

#' Inclusion of superclass
